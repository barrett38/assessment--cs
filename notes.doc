How long does it take to double every number in a given array?
- insert = 1.015501062 s
- append = 28.171084 ms

doubleAppend (func1) seems to be scaling better than 
doubleInsert (func2).There are times that doubleAppend 
takes longer, but overall, doubleAppend is scaling better. 

Extra Credit research:
.Push does not change the index of every item in an array.
.Unshift change the index of every item in the array. This
process takes more time to process.
